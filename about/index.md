I'm an italian entrepreneur and full stack developer based in Salvador, Brazil. I love all about software development, web, mobile, design and digital marketing. I'm a technology enthusiast and developer by passion, having dedicated fourteen years to software engineering, development and web design. Strong background in backend and frontend development. Proven skills in web technologies, primarily PHP and Javascript but also Python and other languages. In my free time I'm a “african” drummer, italian chef and furniture designer.
